phonetic_farsi keyboard
==============

Description
-----------
A phonetically accurate Farsi (Persian) keyboard that includes the Farsi numbers, basic symbols, letters, diacritics and harakat (vowels), along with autocomplete for ligatures (Allah, Muhammad, Rasoolallah).

# Features

To add a diacritic to a letter, type the apostrophe symbol (') after it. Only applies to certain letters.
Diacritic transformation is also added to the letters Alif and Keheh, for their appropriate forms Alif Hamza and Qaf.

To add vowels, hold the Alt key and type the corresponding letter for the vowel sound (a for fathah, i and e for kasra, o and u for damma).
Adding the same vowel twice to the same letter adds the Tanwin form of the vowel to the letter.

Kashida and the zero-width non-joiner characters can be typed using Shift + E and Shift + Spacebar
